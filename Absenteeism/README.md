we'll analyze absenteeism data from a Brazilian courier company, 
collected between July 2007 and July 2010. 
This project is about analyzing employee absence data, the reason for absence, analyzing and verifying hypotheses, dealing with different types of data, and obtaining practical results that help in decision-making.
